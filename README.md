# Cheatsheets

These are a collection of study guides I've created for classes I'm taking. I hope they're useful somehow. These materials are provided under the MIT license, so feel free to contribute or fork your own, or distribute them however you wish.
However, they are meant as study references. I named them "cheatsheets" because that's what my parents called study guides when I was young, but they should not be used for cheating.
As per the MIT license, I am not responsible if any of these materials are used for such purposes, or in any sort of bad faith.

These references are not a replacement for studying using actual study materials. They are only meant to be a convenient compilation of information. I hope they come in handy, though. Enjoy!
