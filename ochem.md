# Organic Chemistry

This cheatsheet is to be used as a reference. It is not a substitution for actually studying. It can help you remember stuff you've already learned, but if you don't know what you're doing, it won't help.

## Nomenclature

### Carbon chains

An **alkane** is an organic molecule with **only single carbon-to-carbon bonds**

An **alkene** is an organic molecule with **one or more double carbon-to-carbon bonds**

An **alkyne** is an organic molecule with **one or more *triple* carbon-to-carbon bonds**

#### Rules for alkenes and alkynes

1. Multiple bond trumps alkyl functional groups groups when it comes to carbon numbering. Number carbons so that the **parent chain includes the multiple bond and that it is on the lowest possible carbon**.
2. Must mention location of multiple bond on a **chain longer than 3**

### Alcohols and Ethers

An **alcohol** is an organic molecule ending with an alcohol **functional group (OH)**. They have the suffix "-ol".

An **ether** is a carbon chain "interrupted" by an Oxygen molecule with the **structure R-O-R**. There are two popular naming schemes for ethers, but we use IUPAC naming.

#### Rules for Alcohols

The fact that a molecule is an alcohol takes precedence over whether it is an alkane/alkene/alkyne. Therefore,

1. You must number carbons so that the **parent chain includes the OH group and that it is on the lowest possible carbon**
2. You must mention the number of the carbon when the **length of the chain is ≥ 3.**
3. The suffix of an alcoholic alkyl would be, for example, methanol, ethenol, or propynol.
   If there are multiple OH groups, the suffix is preceded by the **standard multiple functional group label (e.g. "-diol")**.

#### Rules for Ethers

Ethers are change in the pattern of precedence observed so far. We use the IUPAC naming scheme for naming ethers, so they do not take precedence.

1.  Of the groups on either side of the Oxygen molecule, the **longer group is the parent chain**.
2. The attached group has the **suffix "-oxy"** because it has an oxygen on the end of it (e.g. "methoxy", "ethoxy").
   You must **mention the position** of the alkoxy group when the length of the parent chain is **≥ 3**.
