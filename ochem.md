# Organic Chemistry

This cheatsheet is to be used as a reference. It is not a substitution for actually studying. It can help you remember stuff you've already learned, but if you don't know what you're doing, it won't help.

## Nomenclature

### Carbon chains

An **alkane** is an organic molecule with **only single carbon-to-carbon bonds**

An **alkene** is an organic molecule with **one or more double carbon-to-carbon bonds**

An **alkyne** is an organic molecule with **one or more *triple* carbon-to-carbon bonds**

#### Rules for alkene and alkyne

1. Multiple bond [trumps](#precedence) alkyl functional groups groups when it comes to carbon numbering. Number carbons so that the **parent chain includes the multiple bond and that it is on the lowest possible carbon**.
2. Must mention location of multiple bond on a **chain of length > 3**

### Alcohols and Ethers

An **alcohol** is an organic molecule ending with an alcohol **functional group (OH)**. They have the suffix "-ol".

An **ether** is a carbon chain "interrupted" by an Oxygen molecule with the **structure R-O-R**. There are two popular naming schemes for ethers, but we use IUPAC naming.

#### Rules for Alcohols

The fact that a molecule is an alcohol takes [precedence](#precedence) over whether it is an alkane/alkene/alkyne. Therefore,

1. You must number carbons so that the **parent chain includes the OH group and that it is on the lowest possible carbon**
2. You must mention the number of the carbon when the **length of the chain is ≥ 3.**
3. The suffix of an alcoholic alkyl would be **"-ol"**, for example, methanol, ethenol, or propynol.
   If there are multiple OH groups, the suffix is preceded by the standard multiple functional group label (e.g. "-diol").

#### Rules for Ethers

Ethers are change in the pattern of [precedence](#precedence) observed so far. We use the IUPAC naming scheme for naming ethers, so they do not take precedence.

1.  Of the groups on either side of the Oxygen molecule, the **longer group is the parent chain**.
2. The attached group has the **suffix "-oxy"** because it has an oxygen on the end of it (e.g. "methoxy", "ethoxy").
   You must **mention the position** of the alkoxy group when the length of the parent chain is **≥ 3**.

### Aldehydes and Ketones

A **carbonyl group** is a carbon double bonded to an oxygen (C=O). Understanding and recognizing group is the key to identifying and naming both aldehydes and ketones.

An **aldehyde** is an organic molecule **terminated by a carbonyl group bonded to a hydrogen**. Aldehydes tend to have strong odors. Famous examples are formaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde.

![Aldehyde Structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Aldehyde_general_structure.svg/1200px-Aldehyde_general_structure.svg.png)

A **ketone** is similar to an aldehyde, but the **carbonyl group is on a non-terminating carbon** (i.e. somewhere in the middle of the molecule). Famous examples include acetone.

#### Rules for Aldehydes

Naming aldehydes is relatively easy because of their properties

1. Aldehydes take [precedence](#precedence) over alkyls, alcohols, ethers, and ketones. Since the carbonyl group will *always* be on the terminating carbon of a molecule, **start numbering the parent chain from the carbon in the carbonyl group**.
2. The **suffix for an aldehyde is "-al"**, as in "propanal" or "2-methylbutanal".

#### Rules for Ketones

Naming ketones is slightly more difficult. It's all about finding the carbonyl group.

1. Ketones take [precedence](#precedence) over alkyls, alcohols, and ethers (but not aldehydes!). The **carbon in the carbonyl group must be part of the parent chain.**
2. Number the carbons to **give the ketone the lowest number possible**. **The number will *always* need to be placed in front of the ketone** (e.g. "**2-**propanone"), and can never be 1 or *n* on an *n* carbon chain (because that would just make it an aldehyde).
3. Ketones get the **suffix "-one"**, as in "2-butanone" or "3-methyl-2-heptanone".

### General nomenclature information

#### Precedence

This list is updated based on where we are in class. Look at the [wikipedia precedence list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry#Order_of_precedence_of_groups) for a more complete list.

1. Aldehydes
2. Ketones
3. Alcohols
4. Ethers
5. Alkyls

#### Ordering

##### Ordering of groups of the same precedence

When you have groups of the same precedence but different length, you order the groups alphabetically. This takes precedence over their numerical order (e.g. "4-ethyl-2-methyl").

When you have identical groups on different carbons, the groups are combined with a prefix (e.g. "dimethyl") and the numbers are listed with commas in ascending order (e.g. "3,4-dimethyl"). If they are bonded to the same carbon, the number is listed twice (e.g. "3,3-dimethyl").

##### ≥ 3? > 3?? Which one is it?

The goal of labeling suffixes with number is to remove ambiguity about which carbon the functional group or multiple bond is on. The general rule is that **for a multiple bond, include the prefix number if the parent chain is *greater than 3***, but **for a functional group, include the prefix number if the parent chain is *greater than or equal to 3*** (or greater than 2, same thing).

This is because a multiple bond includes two carbons, so if you had a three carbon chain, no matter where you placed the multiple bond, it would be the same molecule; if you had a 4 carbon chain, however, you could place the bond between the 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 carbons, which would create different molecules. This means names like butene are *ambiguous*. Is butene C=C-C-C, C-C-C=C or C-C=C-C? You couldn't know if you didn't put a number before it. But if you had propene, it could be C-C=C or C=C-C, the same molecule.

Functional groups, on the other hand, involve only one carbon, so the ambiguity arises with one less carbon. For example, if you had an OH group attached to an ethane molecule (ethanol), the structure could be C-C-OH or HO-C-C. These are the same. But if you had an OH attached to a propane molecule (propanol), it could be attached to the 1, 2, or 3 carbons, creating two distinct molecules. Therefore, any chain with a length above 2 would need a numerical prefix to specify which carbon is bonded to a functional group.
